# Titanic_project
This project it to help me refresh the data science notions that I have acquired at Le Wagon

This is an overview of the steps I will take to reach my goals using the titanic data set:
1. Understand the shape of the data (Histograms, box plots...etc)
2. Data cleaning
3. Data exploration
4. Feature engineering
5. Data preprocessing for model
6. Basic model building
7. Model tuning
8. Ensemble model building
9. Results
